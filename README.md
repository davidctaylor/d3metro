# d3metro
DC Metro map implemented using d3js force directed diagram

This is an experimental project that represents Washington DC's WMATA Metro system using a force directed diagram. It allows the selection and display of planned routes, train prediction and, the very approximate location of predicted trains within the network.

Usage
-----
Click on Metro stations to display or reset planned routes. Once selected, train predication data will be displayed

General
-------
This project has been developed (almost) entirely with HTML SVG elements and the D3.js Javascript library. The primary layout has been implemented as a D3 force directed diagram that takes advantage of the collision detection and fisheye functionality.
